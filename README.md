# Solidity Token 




## Brief Description

We created a token using simple funtions in solidity.

### Features of this code : 

- First we made the following local variables for our code : 

```  string public name = "luffy";
  string public power = "gum gum";
  uint public loss = 0;


  mapping(address => uint) public balances;
  ```

- Secondly , I made the mint function to mint some tokens to the account as asked by the Project requirements: 

  ```   function mint(address _add, uint _value) public ```

- Lastly, I made the burn funtion to burn the Tokens as required by the Project:

  ``` function burn(address _add, uint _value) public ```
